# Google Cloud Security Best Practices

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for handling Google Cloud credentials and APIs in your FridgeToPlate application.

## Credential Security

### Service Account Best Practices

1. **Use dedicated service accounts for specific purposes**
   - Create separate service accounts for different services (e.g., Vision API, Storage)
   - Never use the same service account for multiple applications

2. **Apply the principle of least privilege**
   - Grant only the specific permissions needed (e.g., "Cloud Vision API User" role)
   - Avoid using predefined roles that grant excessive permissions
   - Use custom roles when necessary to further restrict access

3. **Secure key management**
   - Rotate service account keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
   - Delete unused service account keys
   - Use a secure method to store and transmit keys (never in code repositories)
   - Consider using Google Cloud Secret Manager for storing sensitive credentials

4. **Monitor service account usage**
   - Enable audit logging for service account activities
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review service account permissions

### Environment Variable Security

1. **Encode sensitive credentials**
   - Use base64 encoding for JSON key files
   - Consider additional encryption for highly sensitive data

2. **Secure environment variables in deployment**
   - Use Render's environment variable feature (or similar in other platforms)
   - Never hardcode credentials in application code
   - Mask sensitive values in logs and error messages

3. **Local development security**
   - Use .env files for local development (excluded from git)
   - Never commit .env files or credential files to repositories
   - Use different credentials for development and production

## API Security

### Google Cloud Vision API

1. **Request limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for API requests
   - Set up quotas in Google Cloud Console
   - Monitor API usage to detect unusual patterns

2. **Error handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
   - Have fallback mechanisms (like mock data) for API unavailability

3. **Data minimization**
   - Only send necessary data to the API
   - Resize images before sending to reduce data transfer
   - Consider preprocessing images to remove metadata

### General API Security

1. **HTTPS everywhere**
   - Ensure all API communications use HTTPS
   - Validate SSL certificates
   - Use modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2+)

2. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user inputs before processing
   - Implement file type and size restrictions for uploads
   - Sanitize file names and paths

3. **Output encoding**
   - Properly encode all output to prevent injection attacks
   - Use secure templating engines
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Application Security

1. **Dependency management**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `safety` or `dependabot` to check for vulnerable packages
   - Minimize the number of dependencies

2. **Secure coding practices**
   - Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

3. **Security testing**
   - Perform regular security assessments
   - Consider automated security scanning tools
   - Implement logging and monitoring for security events

## Incident Response

1. **Prepare for credential compromise**
   - Document steps to revoke and rotate compromised credentials
   - Have a clear process for reporting security incidents
   - Maintain contact information for security teams

2. **Recovery procedures**
   - Document steps to recover from security incidents
   - Regularly test recovery procedures
   - Maintain backups of critical data

3. **Post-incident analysis**
   - Conduct thorough analysis after security incidents
   - Implement lessons learned
   - Update security practices based on findings
